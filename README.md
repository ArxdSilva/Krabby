Platform to develop agents using Belief-Desire-Intention(BDI) model with Multi Agent Systems (MAS) in Golang.

### Why Go?
Go provides tools of [syncronization](https://blog.golang.org/pipelines) & [concurrency](https://talks.golang.org/2012/concurrency.slide#1) natively that match with MAS's needs.
